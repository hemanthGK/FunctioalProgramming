# FunctioalProgramming

Functional programming principles
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==>Functional programming aims to be declarative and treats applications as the 
   result of pure functions which are composed with one another.

==>The primary aim of this style of programming is to avoid the problems that come with shared state,
   mutable data and side effects which are common place in object oriented programming.

==> solving problems thru function(s)


principles :
    Functions as first-class entities
    
    i.e

    => A function can be stored in a variable or value i,e function is first-class citizen
    => A parameter of a function can be a function 
    => The return value of a function can be a function

Benefits

=>Functional programming leads to modular code. You have small functions that you can reuse over and over. 
  Knowing the specific functionality of each function means pinpointing bugs and writing tests should be straightforward,
  especially since the function outputs should be predictable.
